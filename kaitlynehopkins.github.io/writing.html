            <p>This portfolio of writing samples consists of tactical writing pieces created for <a href="http://www.iriefoundation.org/">Irie Foundaiton</a>. All of these written materials have been utilized and implemented by the organization. Below, you will find different tactical writing materials I created for the Foundation to highlight Irie Foundatin's Battle of the DJs: ranging from advisories, to feature stories, to press releases and more! </p>

            <p>Irie Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-proft organization working to create positive impacts on the lives of South Florida's at-risk youth. For Irie Foundation, I created a full Media Kit, including five new specialty programming events to increase awareness and engagement for Irie Foundation by 50 percent by Jan. 1, 2019. One of these specialty programming events created was Irie Foundaiton's Battle of the DJs. Battle of the DJs allows children currently involved in Irie Foundation programming the opportunity to showcase their talents and shine in a DJ competition that brings members of the community together as they vote for the Irie Foundation participant with the best DJ-themed performance on stage.</p>

            <p>If you would like more information about any of these pieces, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>
